# Git Workflow Guide

This document outlines our Git workflow for the top-down action game project, including branching strategies, commit conventions, and pull request processes.

## üå≥ Branching Strategy

```
main
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/UE-123-player-movement
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/UE-456-weapon-system
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ bugfix/UE-789-animation-crash
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deliverable
```

### Branch Types

| Branch Type | Purpose | Naming Convention | Merge Target |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| `main` | Production-ready code | `main` | - |
| `feature/*` | New features | `feature/UE-123-description` | `develop` |
| `bugfix/*` | Bug fixes | `bugfix/UE-456-description` | `develop` |

### Branch Naming Rules

**Format:** `<type>/<ticket-id>-<short-description>`

**Examples:**
```bash
feature/UE-123-player-double-jump
bugfix/UE-456-inventory-ui-overlap
hotfix/UE-789-memory-leak-fix
content/UE-101-medieval-castle-assets
refactor/UE-202-weapon-system-cleanup
```

**Rules:**
- Use lowercase with hyphens
- Include ticket/issue ID (UE-XXX format)
- Keep description concise but descriptive
- No spaces or special characters

## üìù Commit Message Standards

### Commit Types

| `fix` | Bug fixes | `fix(ui): resolve inventory slot overlap` |
| `docs` | Documentation | `docs(readme): update setup instructions` |
| `style` | Code formatting | `style(blueprints): organize node layout` |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring | `refactor(weapons): simplify projectile system` |
